## 🎯 Summary

> I am a PhD candidate specializing in computational/theoretical quantum materials. Using DFT simulations and custom Python codes, I investigate charge transport and dissipation in low-dimensional systems—currently twisted bilayer graphene. I aim to bridge theory and experiment in 2D Quantum device R&D teams.
